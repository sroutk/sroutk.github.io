	doi = {10.1109/ISCAS.2001.921831},
	abstract = {A {BiCMOS} rail-to-rail operational amplifier capable of operating from supply voltages as low as 2.5 V is presented. A new technique of achieving a rail-to-rail input common mode range using a bipolar input stage is developed. The new technique avoids the use of complementary pairs at the input and thus avoids complicated schemes for monitoring the constant gm. The resulting variation of the gm is within +/-5.64\%. The output stage is also rail-to-rail with a class {AB} control providing 5 {mA} of current to a 300 ohm resistor in parallel with a 20 {pF} load. The output stage can swing to within 50 {mV} of each supply rail. The opamp was realized in a conventional 1.2 mu;m {BiCMOS} process with a {DC} gain of 81 {dB} and a unity gain frequency of 7.9 {MHz}},

The minimum supply voltage is equal to {VT+2VDSsat.} As a result, 1 V {SI} cells that exhibit low charge injection errors can be achieved},

A method of interfacing the integrated circuit with external circuitry includes the step of providing the control current {(IP)} from the integrated circuit to a node coupled to a transistor emitter. A compensating current {(IM)} is provided to the node in response to the transistor base current {(IB).} The net node current provided to the emitter is {IPIB} so that the transistor collector current is substantially the same as the control current.

In case of a muti-modal image the segmentation is an involved problem in comparison to a bi-modal image. This paper deals with an adaptive technique for choosing local threshold values for faithful image segmentation. The image segmentation is done by generating a threshold surface which is determined by interpolating the image gray levels at points where the gradient is high, indicating probable object edges. The interpolation of edge points is done using a modified Hopfield neural network and the results are compared with that of a potential surface interpolation method.},
