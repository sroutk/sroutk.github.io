                <p>Saroj Rout received the B.E. degree in Instrumentation and the M.E. degree in Microelectronics from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in">Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS)</a>, Pilani, India, in 1996 and 1998, respectively. He received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a>, Massachusetts, USA, in 2016, where he worked on terahertz metamaterials for his doctoral dissertation. He has taught undergraduate electrical engineering courses both at BITS, Pilani and Tufts University.
From 1998 to 2000, he was a research assistant at <a href="https://www.iastate.edu">Iowa State University</a>, Iowa, USA, where he worked on low-voltage CMOS analog circuit design.</p>
        <p>From 2000 to 2007, he was an analog IC design engineer at <a href="https://www.silabs.com">Silicon Laboratories, Inc.</a> where he worked on high performance CMOS and BiCMOS circuits for applications such as Subscriber Line Interface Circuit (SLIC) for VoIP phones, modems for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), Direct Access Arrangement (DAA) for PC and embedded modems, RF radio tuners and RF TV tuners, of which, two of the products, DAA and SLICs, have sold more than 1.5 Billion units.</p>
	<p>He is the founder and principal engineer at <a href="http://www.mixignal.com">Mixignal Innovations</a>, an analog IC design consulting company and, also the  co-founder and VP of <a href="http://www.bostonmicrotek.com">Boston Microtechnology</a>, a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov">NSF</a>-funded semiconductor startup in the Greater Boston area. He is the Principal Investigator for SBIR Phase-I, a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant. He is the inventor of 8 patents and author of several publications in the area of CMOS circuit design and terahertz metamaterials. 
	He is the author of the book <a href="https://www.ece.tufts.edu/~saroj/active-mm-book.html">"Active Metamaterials"</a>, a Springer-Nature publication.
He is an Adjunct Professor at <a href="https://www.silicon.ac.in">Silicon Institute of Technology</a>, India, where he directs and mentors the <a href="https://silicon-vlsi.github.io">Advanced VLSI Laboratory</a>. He is a <a href="pictures/senior-member-IEEE.jpg">Senior Member, IEEE</a>.
